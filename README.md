## Description

The application allows you to interrogate an external system to view the readings detected by sensors placed in the field.

The interface is built in a very simple way with a menu that allows the selection of some operations such as:

- Display of all managed devices

The page is updated at pre-set time intervals in order to always have an updated reading.
